This 3D printer can print objects up to 300x300x220mm in size and uses a 3D touch sensor to automatically level the bed. Today, a Mega Arduino and a RAMPS 1.4 are being used to control the printer.

### How to build this 3D printer
#### 3D models
All the 3D models I have created to this printer can be found **[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/12J1GdOfxI5U8omSgYnR7kmPH9qL_yAuy)**.

#### Other materials
TODO

Please do not hesitate to contact me when building this printer.
### Future work
- Use a Raspberry PI to control de printer through WiFi.
