The purpose of building this printer is to facilitate the creation of other projects that require 3D printed parts. This 3D printer can print objects up to 280x280x260mm in size. This printer has a 3D touch sensor to automatically level the bed. In addition, I am using a PRINTinZ plate to help fix different types of materials on the bed. For ease of printing, the printer controller is connected to a Raspberry PI with OctoPrint, which allows me to print remotely and monitor printing.

### How to build this 3D printer
#### 3D models
**You can see the 3D modeled printer [here](https://a360.co/32wc3JC).**

It is possible to download all files [here](https://a360.co/32wc3JC).

#### Other materials
- 1x Ramps 1.4
- 1x Arduino Mega
- 2x EndStop buttons
- 1x Headbed MK2a 300mm
- 1x PRINTinZ plate 300mm
- 1x 128x64 LCD controller for ramps 1.4
- 5x Nema 14 stepper motors
- 1x 3D touch sensor
- 1x Raspberry Pi 3 B+
- 1x Raspberry Pi Camera v2
- (...)

### Future work
- In addition to the 3D printing function I intend to adapt the printer to work as a CNC to create PCBs.
